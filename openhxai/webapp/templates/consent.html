						Please read the consent form below carefully before proceeding.
						To begin on the study, please click on "Accept HIT" and follow this link to our <a id="research_site" target="_blank" href="#">research site</a>.
						The link will only be valid after you click on "Accept HIT".
					</p>
					
					<p>
						In each assignment, you will be trained to distinguish deceptive from genuine reviews, 
						determine the authenticity of 20 reviews, and complete an exit survey to receive a survey code. 
						<b>Deceptive reviews are defined as the ones written by people who had never been to the hotel 
						and imagined their experience. </b>
					</p>

					<p>
						Your submission will be considered after you copy the survey code into this form. 
						The training process involves distinguishing green from red. 
						Please note that it may take us up to 10 days to review your responses though we hope to 
						proceed with things faster than that.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Please also note that we reserve the right to reject any assignments that are deemed as poor quality.
						Poor quality assignments are defined as assignments that are completed hastily.
